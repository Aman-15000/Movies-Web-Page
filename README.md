# Project Title: Movies Website 🎬

## Overview
This project is a dynamic and responsive web application for browsing and discovering information about movies and web series. The application leverages modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and integrates with a third-party API (like [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://www.themoviedb.org) or [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com)) to fetch and display up-to-date data, including titles, synopses, ratings, and cast details.

The primary motivation for this project was to build a user-friendly platform for movie enthusiasts while enhancing my skills in fetching and handling data from APIs using vanilla JavaScript.

## Features
*   **Intuitive Search:** Easily find your favorite movies or TV shows by title.
*   **Detailed Views:** Click on a movie to see comprehensive details, including plot, release year, and ratings.
*   **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless user experience across various devices, from desktop to mobile.
*   **Genre Filtering (Optional):** Explore movies by specific genres (if implemented).

## Technologies Used
*   **HTML5:** For the core structure of the web pages.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and responsive design.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For interactivity, fetching API data, and dynamic content manipulation.
*   **[The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://www.themoviedb.org) or [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com):** For accessing movie data.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
*   A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)).
*   An API Key from a movie database service (if required). For [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org), you will need to register and obtain a developer key.
    *   *If using an API key, make sure to follow best practices (e.g., store it as an environment variable or a local config file, and do not commit it directly to the repository).*

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-movie-app-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Open the project:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser or use a live server extension in your code editor (like [Live Server for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com)) to launch a local development server.

## Usage
Simply open the application in your browser. Use the search bar to look up different movies or browse the homepage's featured list. No additional steps are needed for basic use.
